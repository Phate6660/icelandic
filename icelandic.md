This is Phate6660's personal notes for learning Icelandic.<br>

## Typing Special Characters

### Linux
First you need to set up the compose key on Xorg.<br>
I'll leave you to do that on your own, it's out of the scope of this as<br>
depending on what DE/WM you're using, there are various different ways to enable it.

### Windows
I came across [wincompose](https://github.com/SamHocevar/wincompose) while making my own AHK script.<br>
Once I found it, honestly I fell in love with it. The rest of this document will assume you're using it. 

### Sequences
**The compose key needs to be pressed before all shortcuts.**<br>
However a nice thing is that the key has a rollover effect.<br>
Meaning that it doesn't need to stay pressed down, you can press the keys in order one-by-one.

| Shortcut | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| '-a      | á         |
| '-A      | Á         |
| '-e      | é         |
| '-E      | É         |
| '-i      | í         |
| '-I      | Í         |
| '-o      | ó         |
| '-O      | Ó         |
| '-y      | ý         |
| '-Y      | Ý         |
| "-o      | ö         |
| "-O      | Ö         |
| a-e      | æ         |
| A-E      | Æ         |
| d-h      | ð         |
| D-H      | Ð         |
| t-h      | þ         |
| T-H      | Þ         |

## Pronunciations
If unspecified, assume that the pronounciation is the same as the english letter.

## Grammar

### Nouns
They are declined in 4 cases:

- nominative (a noun that is doing something)
- accusative (the direct object of a transitive verb)
- dative (the receipent of an action)
- genitive (a word that modifies another word, sometimes used in an adverbial sense)

There are also gender-specific suffixes for words:

- for masculine we have `-ur`, `-i`, `-ll`, or `-nn`
- for feminine we have `-a`, `-ing`, or `-un`
- gender neutral nouns usually either don't have suffixes or have a final accented vowel

### Articles
Indefinite articles (such as a/an) do not exist, but there are definite articles.

They would be...

Singular (without articles):

- for masculine we have `-ur`, `-i`, `-ll`, and `-nn`
- for feminine we have `-a`

Singular (with article):

- for masculine we have `-urinn`, `-inn`, `-llinn`, and `-nninn`
- for feminine we have `-in` and `-an`
- for gender neutral we have `-ið`

Plural (without article):

- for masculine we have `-ar`
- for feminine we have `ir` and `ur`

Plural (with article):

- for masculine we have `-arnir`
- for feminine we have `irnar` and `-urnar`
- for gender neutral we have `-in`

#### Examples

Examples showing nouns for each respective gender declined in nominative:

- Dreng**ur** (a boy), becomes dreng**urinn** (the boy)
- Stúlk**a** (a girl), becomes stúlk**an** (the girl)
- Barn (a child), becomes barnið (the child)
